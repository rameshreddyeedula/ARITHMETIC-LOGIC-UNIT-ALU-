## As part of my VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) course, Task-1 required me to design and simulate a basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) capable of performing essential arithmetic and logical operations. The ALU was implemented using VHDL, a widely used hardware description language for modeling digital systems. The objective of the task was to create a digital component that can execute fundamental operations such as addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, bitwise OR, and bitwise NOT. To achieve this, I utilized the EDAPlayground platform, which provides a user-friendly environment for writing, simulating, and debugging hardware description code. I started by coding the main ALU module in VHDL, where I defined two 4-bit input ports, A and B, a 3-bit control signal to select the desired operation, and an output port to display the result. 

## The ALU was designed such that each operation corresponds to a unique control code—for example, '000' for addition, '001' for subtraction, '010' for AND, '011' for OR, and '100' for NOT. The NOT operation only used input A and ignored input B, as expected in logical inversion. After completing the ALU code, I developed a testbench to simulate and verify its functionality by feeding in various sets of binary input values. Some of the test inputs used during the simulation included binary values such as 1001, 1011, and 1000, which helped test the ALU under different conditions. One example test case used A = 0001 and B = 0001, and when the control signal selected the addition operation, the ALU produced the correct result of 0010, verifying that the addition logic was functioning as intended. I then ran the simulation on EDAPlayground to ensure that the design was syntactically and functionally correct. Since no errors were detected during compilation, I proceeded to run the simulation, which produced accurate outputs for all the tested operations.

## The output displayed in the simulation console confirmed that all arithmetic and logic operations behaved as expected, and the testbench successfully validated each result. The entire process—from writing the ALU and testbench code to simulating and observing the outputs—provided a comprehensive understanding of how hardware modules are designed, implemented, and verified in VLSI systems. This task not only strengthened my skills in writing VHDL code but also enhanced my ability to work with simulation tools, interpret binary operations, and debug hardware-level logic. Furthermore, it emphasized the importance of testbenches in hardware development, as they play a critical role in ensuring that each module performs accurately before hardware deployment. Overall, Task-1 served as an essential introduction to digital system design and simulation, giving me a hands-on opportunity to explore the core building blocks of processors through the practical implementation of a basic but functional ALU.
